We've been working hard to make GitLocalize better. Check out what we've done.

### 🔍Filters

Translating updates has just become easier. You can now select to display only untranslated strings or only machine translated strings, which is especially important if you're working on large files. Just click on the filter icon in the top right part of the editor screen

and select the desired view:

### 🏷The GitLocalized Badge

If you want your community to see the translation progress in your project, feel free to add our ![GitLocalized](/img/badge.svg) badge to your Readme file, Wiki or Contributing Guidelines.



Check out how other projects are using our badge:
